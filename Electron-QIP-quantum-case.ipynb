    "\n",
    "In our case, $H_{sys} = H_{motion}$, $H_{env} = H_{circuit}$, $H_{int}$ is the coupling illustrated above.\n",

    "we can at this point perform a partial trace over the environmental degrees of freedom, and thereby obtain a master equation for the motion of the original system density matrix. The most general trace-preserving and completely positive form of this evolution is the Lindblad master equation for the reduced density matrix $$\\rho = Tr_{env}[\\rho_{tot}] $$\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the requirements to arrive at the master equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Separability: At $t=0$ there are no correlations between the system and its environment such that the total density matrix can be written as a tensor product  $\\rho^I_{tot}(0) = \\rho^I_{tot}(0) \\bigotimes \\rho^I_{env}(0) $\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Born approximation: Requires: (1) that the state of the environment does not significantly change as a result of the interaction with the system; (2) The system and the environment remain separable throughout the evolution. These assumptions are justified if the interaction is weak, and if the environment is much larger than the system. In summary, $\\rho_{tot}(t) = \\rho_{tot}(t) \\bigotimes \\rho_{env} $\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Markov approximation The time-scale of decay for the environment $\\tau_{env}$ is much shorter than the smallest time-scale of the system dynamics $\\tau_{sys}>>\\tau_{env} $. This approximation is often deemed a ‚Äúshort-memory environment‚Äù as it requires that environmental correlation functions decay on a time-scale fast compared to those of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Secular approximation Stipulates that elements in the master equation corresponding to transition frequencies satisfy |ùúîùëéùëè‚àíùúîùëêùëë|‚â™1/ùúèsys\n",
    ", i.e., all fast rotating terms in the interaction picture can be neglected. It also ignores terms that lead to a small renormalization of the system energy levels. This approximation is not strictly necessary for all master-equation formalisms (e.g., the Block-Redfield master equation), but it is required for arriving at the Lindblad form (3) which is used in qutip.mesolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically:\n",

    "1. systems are not strongly coupled to their environment, the decay rates $\\gamma_n$ be smaller than the minimum energy splitting in the system Hamiltonian.\n",

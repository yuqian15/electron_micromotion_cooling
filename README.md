Electron Micromotion Cooling Project

Description:

Micromotion cooling for electron is a novel way for electron to be cooled down below the tank circuit temperature. Compared to usual tank circuit cooling method, which couples the tank circuit resonance mode to the electron secular motional mode(like axial mode or radial secular motion mode), the micromotion cooling couples the tank circuit resonance mode to the electron micromotion mode only in radial directions(x and y). The expectation of micromotion
